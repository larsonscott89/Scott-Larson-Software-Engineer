          <p className='about-me-main'>Greetings! I have a background in troubleshooting automation systems in the refined fuels industry and 5 years in a commission based sales experience. Originally from Texas and now based in Ocala, Florida, I've cultivated a deep appreciation for the intersection of human intellect and technological innovation.</p>

          <p className='about-me-main'>My journey into software engineering began when I was troubleshooting automation systems. The intricacies of how the systems work scratched a particular part of my brain and through my experiences at General Assembly, I have gained proficiency in various technologies. However, my true passion lies in game developmentâ€”a realm where creativity flourishes and imagination knows no bounds. Despite the competitive nature of the field, my enthusiasm remains undeterred as I seek every opportunity to refine my skills and work towards my ultimate goal.</p>

          <p className='about-me-main'>In every project, whether it's crafting intuitive user interfaces or delving into algorithmic complexities, I am committed to excellence. Challenges are viewed as opportunities for growth, and my aspiration is to leverage my skills to create transformative gaming experiences that resonate with users and make a lasting impact on the world. Join me as we explore the frontiers of technology, embrace innovation, and embark on a journey of discovery and collaboration towards a future where gaming serves as a catalyst for positive change.</p>
