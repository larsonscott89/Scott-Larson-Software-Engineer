# Scott-Larson-Software-Engineer
## Technologies used:
##### React
##### React Icons
##### Swiper
## Goal
##### To bring on a website that shows off my projects in an elegant way. I want the user to be able to navigate my profile in an effeciant manner. The navbar on the right-hand side slides out so there is maximum material on the page at a given time. Each item in my navbar (Home, About Me, Projects, Contact Me) have a relevant path to the specific pages. 
## Planning
### Header
##### Create a custom header to add as a picture with my name, email and phone number.
### Home
##### Add my Brand statement along  with a photo that best summerizes what I feel a software engineer does.
### About Me
##### Speak a little about myself and my journey to becoming a software engineer. Add a photo so the user can see what I look like (put a name to the face). Use CSS to allow the page to have a nice asthetic.
### Projects
##### A short intro to my projects page.
##### Install swiper to allow the user to look at several screenshots of my projects because just reading about them just isn't enough.
##### Add the project descriptions. Talk about the technologies used and what it does. Add a link to their respective GitHub as well so people can see the source code.
### Contact Me
##### Very simple. Add my email address that people can contact me directly through. 
##### Create a Candendly for people who would rather set up a meeting on their own timeline.
### Footer
##### Add a link for the source code of my portfolio
##### GitHub link for my whole GitHub
##### Add other relevant socials
